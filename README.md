Repository Name: Advanced Linked Lists

Description: This repository contains advanced functions/operation on a Linked List (Double Ended)

Time complexities:

Deletion at end/beginning = O(1)
Insertion at end/beginning = O(1)
Insertion/Deletion at position p = Best: O(1); Average: O(p); Worst: O(n)
Display = O(n)
